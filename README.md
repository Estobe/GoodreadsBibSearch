# GoodreadsBibSearch
This is a web application that helps you find books from your Goodreads to-read list at the Osnabr√ºck City Library.

## Setup
To initialize, add an environment variable called `GOODREADS_USERNAME` for your goodreads username.
The username has to contain the number, as you can see in the url when visiting you profile.
For example `GOODREADS_USERNAME=447917412-username`.

## Disclaimer
The current version of the application uses webcrawling to search for the books.
This is very slow and can take several minutes, until the results show up.
